# Sobel Edge Detection Hardware (SystemVerilog)

This project implements a real-time, flexible edge detection accelerator in SystemVerilog. It performs 3√ó3 convolution using 4 configurable kernels (Sobel and diagonal by default) and applies a threshold to detect edges in streaming grayscale images. The design is optimized for FPGA/ASIC integration and is fully configurable via an AMBA APB interface.

## üì¶ Features

- 4 parallel 3√ó3 convolution kernels (default: Sobel X/Y + diagonals)
- Thresholding: output is 0 or gradient magnitude
- Streaming architecture with 1-pixel-per-cycle input
- Valid-in/valid-out handshake for input/output flow control
- Line buffer with SRAM for 3-row sliding window
- APB interface for runtime configuration of image size, threshold, and kernels
- Scalable and modular SystemVerilog design

## üß† Architecture Overview

The system consists of the following main modules:

- **Line Buffer**  
  Buffers 3 rows of pixels using SRAM. Generates a valid 3√ó3 sliding window as pixels stream in.

- **Convolution Calculator**  
  Applies 4 independent 3√ó3 kernels (default: Sobel X, Sobel Y, and two diagonals). Each kernel computes a gradient response for the current window. The maximum response is passed to the threshold block.

- **Threshold Block**  
  Compares the maximum of the 4 gradient responses to a programmable threshold. If the value is greater than or equal to the threshold, the output is the magnitude; otherwise, the output is 0.

- **Controller**  
  Coordinates valid signals, manages the sliding window generation, and synchronizes processing start and stop.

- **APB Register File**  
  Receives configuration from an external CPU or testbench using the AMBA APB protocol. Allows runtime control of image size, threshold value, and kernel weights.

## üñºÔ∏è Input/Output Interface

### üîÑ Streaming Data

- **Inputs**
  - `pixel_in [7:0]` ‚Äî Grayscale input pixel (1 per clock cycle)
  - `valid_in` ‚Äî High when `pixel_in` is valid

- **Outputs**
  - `gradient_out [7:0]` ‚Äî Output gradient magnitude (or 0 if below threshold)
  - `valid_out` ‚Äî High when `gradient_out` is valid

Once 3 full rows are buffered, `valid_out` follows `valid_in` with a short latency. Output values represent the strongest response from the 4 kernels (after thresholding).

### üõ†Ô∏è Control Interface (APB)

The module is configured via an **AMBA APB interface**, with the following programmable registers:

| Register         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `image_width`    | Number of pixels per row                                                    |
| `total_pixels`   | Total number of pixels to process                                           |
| `threshold`      | Minimum gradient magnitude to keep as output                               |
| `kernel_0`       | 3√ó3 kernel (default: Sobel X if all elements = 0)                           |
| `kernel_1`       | 3√ó3 kernel (default: Sobel Y if all elements = 0)                           |
| `kernel_2`       | 3√ó3 kernel (default: Diagonal 1 if all elements = 0)                        |
| `kernel_3`       | 3√ó3 kernel (default: Diagonal 2 if all elements = 0)                        |
| `start`          | Start processing once all configs are loaded                               |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** If a kernel is written with all-zero values, the corresponding **default kernel** will be used internally (see below).
